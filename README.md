### Note

This project was developed in 2 weeks as part of the Databases Lab. course at University of SÃ£o Paulo.
The project aims to offer a simple HTML interface, to allow for some user interaction with the database. The main objective was to connect the database to a back-end API and make it usable with HTTP requests.

THIS APP IS A PROTOTYPE, DO NOT EXPECT A PRODUCTION READY PRODUCT.
